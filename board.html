                One of the first assignments was to create a visual identity board. The visual identity board provides a reference document for all future design endeavors. It contains logos, fonts, symbols, colorscheme, and any other relevant items a designer would need. This document was used in designing all assignments that followed. The visual identity board is an essential piece to any design project

                For the fonts, I chose Norwester as the main font, with streetwear as an alternate. I wanted the main font to have a strong, clean appearance that would be easy to read. Streetwear was chosen as an alternate for items such as apparel. I wanted a font distinctly different from the main font, but that was also aesthetically pleasing.
                </p>

                The colorscheme was chosen to represent royalty, as griffins were said to protect royal families. These colors were also chosen to stand out against the predominent colors of the other NFL teams in the region, which consist of Orange, Brown, Black, and Yellow.
                </p>
                <p>
                Finally, the symbols consist of the main griffin logo, along with the helmet design. The helmet design incorporates all colors of the colorscheme.
